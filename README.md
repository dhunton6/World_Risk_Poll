According to the host website,“The Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk Poll is the first global study of worry and risk across the world. The findings of the World Risk Poll are based on over 150,000 interviews by Gallup in 142 countries including places where little or no official data exists, giving a voice for the first time to millions of the world’s citizens.”  This project takes a glance at the past experiences of risk and compares it to the feeling of being at risk for future injury or disaster.
